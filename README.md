### _ **Introduction:** _

#### The title of the project is

#### _&quot;beauty parlor management system&quot;._

#### We have made the relational tables to make the database system and their information. We have the descriptions of the query that is required to create the tables and insert the values in the tables. We had to go through the normalization process to overcome data insertion, deletion and update anomalies to decide the tables to be created.

#### We do believe that this project will be beneficial to a lot of new or updatable parlor management system.
